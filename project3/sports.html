<p>The RIT "Tigers" became the official mascot for the school in 1955-56, following an undefeated basketball season. 
Originally the mascot was called "Techmen" and the school colors were blue and gray. 
Harry Watts, former sports information director, saw the lack in team identification and suggested "Tiger" in 1955.
About two years later, the school adopted burnt umber, orange, and white as the official school athletic colors.</p>
<h1>Sport Teams</h1>
<p>RIT teams are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), 
the Atlantic Hockey Association, the Liberty League, and the New York State Womenâ€™s Collegiate Athletic Association.</p>
